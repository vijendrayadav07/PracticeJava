#  Java with Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository is a collection of my hands-on Java practice focused on mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It includes fundamental to advanced problems implemented in clean, structured Java code.

---

##  Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A learning log for **core DSA concepts**
- A practice ground for **coding interviews**
- A reference point for **clean Java code implementations**
- A foundation for building **logical thinking and problem-solving skills**
